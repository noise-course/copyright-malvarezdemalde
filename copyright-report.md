## 1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis (YouTube)

For this assignment, I selected YouTube as the platform of analysis due to its highly developed and widely used copyright enforcement infrastructure. YouTube hosts vast amounts of user-generated content and must balance creator freedom, copyright compliance, and platform scalability, making it a particularly relevant case study for examining how copyright law is enforced in practice.

### Copyright Detection Mechanisms

YouTube primarily detects copyrighted content through an automated system known as Content ID. Content ID works by comparing uploaded videos against a database of reference files submitted by copyright holders, including music labels, film studios, and sports leagues. These reference files include both audio and visual fingerprints, allowing YouTube to identify matches even in short clips or altered content.

In addition to automated detection, YouTube also supports manual copyright enforcement through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Rights holders can submit takedown requests for content they believe infringes their copyright. Manual DMCA takedowns are more serious than Content ID claims and can result in copyright strikes against a channel.

### What Happens When Content Is Flagged

When YouTube detects copyrighted content through Content ID, the platform applies the policy chosen by the copyright owner. These policies may include blocking the video entirely, blocking it in specific regions, monetizing the video on behalf of the copyright owner, or simply tracking viewership statistics. Importantly, Content ID claims are not copyright strikes and do not automatically penalize a user’s channel.

If content is removed through a DMCA takedown rather than Content ID, the uploader receives a copyright strike, which can lead to channel restrictions or termination after repeated violations.

### Appeals and Counter-Notification Process

YouTube provides users with the ability to dispute Content ID claims if they believe the content qualifies as fair use, is licensed, or is otherwise authorized. If a dispute is rejected, the user may appeal the decision, at which point the copyright owner must either uphold the claim or issue a formal takedown request.

For DMCA takedowns, users may submit a counter-notification, asserting that the removal was erroneous. This process involves legal risk, as it requires the user to provide personal information and assert rights under penalty of perjury. If the copyright owner does not pursue legal action after a counter-notification, the content may be reinstated.

### Monetization of Copyrighted Content

When a Content ID claim results in monetization, YouTube allows the video to remain available while directing advertising revenue to the copyright owner rather than the uploader. Uploaders cannot monetize claimed content unless the claim is released. This system effectively allows copyright owners to profit from user-uploaded content without removing it, particularly in cases involving music or sports footage.

### Special Programs and Licensing Arrangements

YouTube’s Content ID system itself functions as a large-scale licensing and enforcement program. Many major rights holders, such as record labels and sports leagues, have negotiated agreements that allow them to set automated rules for how their content is handled. This gives large rights holders significant control over enforcement outcomes and places individual creators at a structural disadvantage.

### Policy Versus Observed Behavior

YouTube’s stated policy emphasizes respect for fair use and provides mechanisms for dispute and appeal. However, as observed in the experiments conducted in Sections 2 and 3, enforcement in practice is driven by automated matching rather than legal analysis. Content is often blocked or claimed before any fair use evaluation occurs, and AI-generated content that does not match known reference files can bypass enforcement entirely.

This gap between policy language and actual enforcement highlights the central tension of YouTube’s copyright system: it is designed for efficiency and scale, not nuanced legal judgment.

## 2. Fair Use Experiments

For this section, I conducted two experiments on YouTube using the same underlying copyrighted sports footage: a short clip from a Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester United. The purpose of these experiments was to test how YouTube’s copyright enforcement system responds to (1) a non-transformative use of copyrighted material and (2) a transformative use of the same material involving commentary and visual modification.

### Experiment 1: Raw Premier League Clip (Non-Transformative Use)

#### Description of the Content

The first upload consisted of a short, unedited clip of a Premier League goal. The video contained no commentary, no pauses, and no visual alterations. It reproduced broadcast footage exactly as it appeared during the live match, including the match audio, the scoreboard, and broadcast graphics.

#### Platform Response

YouTube’s automated copyright detection system flagged the video almost immediately during the upload process, taking only 30 seconds. The platform indicated that copyright-protected content had been found and that the video could not be viewed. The claim identified the copyrighted material as footage from “GW15, Wolves v Manchester United, 08/12/2025”, and listed the content owner as the FA Premier League. The impact on the video was a global block, preventing playback in all regions.

In addition to the in-platform warning, YouTube sent a formal email notification confirming the enforcement action. The email stated that copyrighted content had been detected in the video titled “Premier League Clip” and that, as a result, the video had been blocked and could no longer be played on YouTube. The message clarified that this action did not constitute a copyright strike and did not affect the standing of my channel. The email also outlined available options, including trimming or removing the copyrighted segment, disputing the claim if I believed I had the rights to the content, or reuploading a modified version. A screenshot of this email is included in the appendix.

Editing options within YouTube Studio were effectively unavailable, as the entire clip consisted of copyrighted visual material. The video remained blocked.

#### Outcome

The raw clip was fully blocked and rendered inaccessible. This outcome reflects YouTube’s strict enforcement of copyright protections for sports broadcasts when content is uploaded without any transformative elements.

### Experiment 2: Transformative Premier League Clip (Commentary and Visual Analysis)

#### Description of the Content

The second upload used the same Premier League footage but incorporated multiple transformative elements. I added my own voiceover commentary analyzing player positioning and tactical movement. I inserted a freeze-frame at a key moment in the play and overlaid a directional arrow to visually highlight a specific player’s run. These modifications changed both the purpose and presentation of the footage, shifting it from entertainment or redistribution to analysis and explanation.

#### Platform Response

Unlike the first experiment, YouTube’s copyright checks for this video reported “No issues found.” The video was not flagged, claimed, blocked, or restricted in any way after a 20-second check. No Content ID claim was issued, and no follow-up email notification was sent. The video remained fully accessible.

#### Outcome

The transformed video was allowed to remain on the platform without any copyright enforcement action. Despite using the same underlying footage, the addition of commentary, pausing, and visual overlays altered the video sufficiently that YouTube’s automated detection system did not identify it as infringing content.

#### Interpretation

These two experiments demonstrate a stark contrast in how YouTube enforces copyright depending on the nature of the use. The non-transformative clip was immediately blocked, accompanied by both in-platform warnings and a direct email notification, underscoring YouTube’s aggressive enforcement of broadcast sports rights. By contrast, the transformed video, although derived from the same copyrighted source, was allowed without restriction.

This outcome suggests that YouTube’s enforcement system is sensitive not only to the presence of copyrighted material but also to how that material is presented. Transformative elements such as commentary, pauses, and visual annotations can significantly alter enforcement outcomes, even though YouTube’s system does not explicitly evaluate fair use as a legal doctrine. Instead, enforcement appears to depend on whether the content matches known copyrighted assets closely enough to trigger automated detection.

## 3. AI-Generated Content Investigation

For this section, I created and uploaded two pieces of AI-generated content using Grok as the image generation tool and YouTube as the hosting platform. The two experiments were designed to test different dimensions of copyright similarity: (1) a direct reference to copyrighted material and (2) style mimicry of a well-known artist.

Both pieces of content were uploaded as short, unlisted YouTube videos in order to observe YouTube’s automated copyright enforcement behavior without risking public distribution.

### AI Experiment 1: Direct Reference to a Copyrighted Character (Spider-Man)

The AI tool used was Grok. The category of the content was a direct reference to copyrighted material. The AI prompt was: “Create a detailed image of Spider-Man swinging between skyscrapers in New York City at sunset.” This prompt explicitly references Spider-Man, a copyrighted character owned by Marvel, and therefore represents a clear case of direct reference to copyrighted intellectual property.

#### AI-Generated Output

Grok successfully generated a high-quality, realistic image depicting Spider-Man in his recognizable red-and-blue suit, swinging between tall buildings in a New York City–like environment. The character’s appearance, pose, and costume were clearly identifiable as Spider-Man.

A screenshot of the AI interface showing both the prompt and the generated image is included in the appendix.

#### Upload to YouTube

The image was converted into a short static video and uploaded to YouTube under the title “AI Generated Spider Man Image Test.”

#### Platform Response

- YouTube’s Checks system reported: “No issues found.”
- No Content ID claim was issued.
- The video was not blocked, muted, or demonetized.
- Visibility was unrestricted.

Screenshots of the upload details page, copyright checks page, and final video playback page are included in the appendix.

#### Interpretation

Despite the image depicting a well-known copyrighted character, YouTube did not flag or restrict the content. This suggests that YouTube’s copyright enforcement system relies primarily on fingerprint matching of known audio and video assets, rather than evaluating character likeness or visual similarity alone. AI-generated images of copyrighted characters can therefore bypass detection if they do not match a specific reference file in YouTube’s Content ID database.

### AI Experiment 2: Style Mimicry (“In the Style of Claude Monet”)

The AI tool used was Grok. The category of the content was style mimicry. The AI prompt was: “Create an original landscape painting in the style of Claude Monet, with impressionist brush strokes, soft colors, and reflections on water.” This prompt requests content “in the style of” Claude Monet, a famous Impressionist painter whose works are in the public domain. The prompt does not reference any specific Monet painting, only his artistic style.

#### AI-Generated Output

Grok generated an original impressionist-style landscape featuring a reflective body of water, loose brush strokes, and pastel color tones characteristic of Monet’s style, while remaining visually distinct from any specific copyrighted artwork.

A screenshot of the AI-generated image and the prompt is included in the appendix.

#### Upload to YouTube

The image was converted into a short video and uploaded to YouTube under the title “AI Generated Artwork in the Style of Monet.”

#### Platform Response

- YouTube’s Checks system reported: “No issues found.”
- No copyright claims or restrictions were applied.
- The video was fully allowed.

Screenshots of the upload process, checks page, and final video playback are included in the appendix.

#### Interpretation

YouTube did not flag the video despite the explicit reference to Monet’s artistic style. This indicates that style mimicry is not evaluated or enforced by YouTube’s copyright detection systems. While individual Monet paintings may be protected through museum photography rights, stylistic imitation alone does not trigger automated enforcement.

### Research Findings

#### AI Tool Terms of Service

Grok allows users to generate images and grants users rights to use the generated outputs, while placing responsibility on the user to ensure compliance with copyright law. Unlike some AI tools that block copyrighted characters, Grok permitted the generation of Spider-Man imagery.

#### Copyright Ownership of AI-Generated Content

The copyright status of AI-generated content remains legally uncertain. Under current U.S. Copyright Office guidance, purely AI-generated works without meaningful human authorship may not qualify for copyright protection. However, users typically control and can distribute the outputs subject to platform rules.

#### YouTube’s Policy on AI-Generated Content

YouTube permits AI-generated content and evaluates it under the same copyright framework as other uploads. Enforcement is primarily driven by Content ID matches, not by conceptual similarity, character identity, or artistic style. As a result, both AI-generated videos were allowed without restriction.

### Key Takeaway from Section 3

These experiments demonstrate a clear gap between copyright law, AI generation policies, and platform enforcement. While copyrighted characters and artistic styles are protected under intellectual property law, YouTube’s automated systems do not effectively detect AI-generated images that resemble protected works unless they match known copyrighted assets. This creates a significant enforcement gap in the age of generative AI.

## 4. Legal Analysis

This section applies U.S. copyright law, specifically the four-factor fair use test, to the experiments conducted in Sections 2 and 3. It then evaluates the extent to which YouTube’s actual enforcement behavior aligns with, or diverges from, legal doctrine.

### Fair Use Analysis: Premier League Experiments

The two Premier League uploads provide a clear contrast between non-transformative and transformative uses of copyrighted material.

#### Experiment 1: Raw Premier League Clip

##### Purpose and Character of the Use

The raw clip consisted of an unedited broadcast segment of a Premier League goal. The purpose of the upload was not commentary, criticism, education, or parody, but rather simple redistribution of the original content. The use was non-transformative and did not add new meaning or expression. This factor weighs strongly against fair use.

##### Nature of the Copyrighted Work

Sports broadcasts are highly produced audiovisual works that include creative elements such as camera angles, graphics, commentary, and editing. Courts generally treat such broadcasts as creative rather than factual works. This factor weighs against fair use.

##### Amount and Substantiality Used

Although the clip was short in duration, it captured the most significant moment of the match: the goal. Courts have repeatedly held that copying the “heart” of a work weighs against fair use even if the excerpt is brief. This factor weighs against fair use.

##### Effect on the Market

The clip directly substitutes for licensed highlights and competes with the Premier League’s own distribution of match footage. Allowing such uploads would undermine the market for official highlights and licensed broadcasts. This factor weighs strongly against fair use.

##### Conclusion

All four factors weigh against fair use. YouTube’s decision to block the video globally is fully consistent with copyright law in this case.

#### Experiment 2: Transformative Premier League Clip (Commentary and Visual Analysis)

##### Purpose and Character of the Use

The transformed video added original voiceover commentary, freeze-frames, and visual annotations to analyze player positioning and tactics. The purpose shifted from entertainment or redistribution to explanation and analysis. This type of use closely aligns with criticism and educational commentary, which courts routinely recognize as transformative. This factor weighs strongly in favor of fair use.

##### Nature of the Copyrighted Work

As with the first experiment, the underlying broadcast remains a creative work. This factor still weighs slightly against fair use, but it is generally given less weight when the use is highly transformative.

##### Amount and Substantiality Used

Only the portion of the footage necessary to support the analysis was used, and it was interrupted by pauses and overlays. The clip was not presented in continuous, consumable form. This factor weighs in favor of fair use.

##### Effect on the Market

The transformed video does not serve as a substitute for official highlights or live broadcasts. Viewers seeking to watch the match or its highlights would not treat the analysis video as a replacement. Instead, it serves a different market function. This factor weighs strongly in favor of fair use.

##### Conclusion

On balance, the four factors favor fair use. Although YouTube does not explicitly adjudicate fair use, its system allowed the video to remain available, which in this instance aligns with legal doctrine.

### Legal Analysis: AI-Generated Content Experiments

The AI experiments raise different legal questions, particularly around copyright ownership and infringement rather than fair use.

#### AI Experiment 1: Spider-Man Image (Direct Reference)

The AI-generated Spider-Man image depicts a copyrighted character, which is generally protected under copyright law. Creating and distributing derivative works featuring copyrighted characters without authorization may constitute infringement. However, YouTube did not flag or restrict the upload.

From a legal perspective, the lack of enforcement does not imply legality. Rather, it reflects the limitations of automated detection systems. Content ID is designed to match known audiovisual assets, not to assess character likeness or derivative imagery. As a result, potentially infringing content can remain available even when it would be legally questionable.

#### AI Experiment 2: Monet-Style Image (Style Mimicry)

Imitating the artistic style of Claude Monet does not violate copyright law. Copyright protects specific expressions, not general styles or techniques. Because Monet’s works are in the public domain, and because the AI-generated image does not copy any specific painting, the output is legally permissible.

YouTube’s lack of enforcement in this case aligns with copyright law, even though the platform does not explicitly assess stylistic imitation.

### Relevant Case Law

U.S. courts have repeatedly emphasized that fair use analysis depends on transformation and purpose rather than mere copying. In Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., the Supreme Court held that transformative uses (those that add new meaning, expression, or message) are more likely to qualify as fair use, even when they involve commercially valuable copyrighted works. This principle supports the conclusion that the transformed Premier League clip, which added commentary and visual analysis, aligns with legally recognized fair use despite YouTube’s lack of an explicit legal evaluation.

Similarly, in Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., the Supreme Court reaffirmed that copying portions of copyrighted material can constitute fair use when the use serves a new and distinct purpose and does not meaningfully harm the original market. Although the context differs, the case reinforces the importance of purpose and market effect, both of which favor the transformed sports clip and weigh against the raw, non-transformative upload.

With respect to AI-generated content, courts have not yet directly addressed the copyright status of purely AI-generated works. However, existing doctrine makes clear that copyright protects specific expressions rather than general ideas, concepts, or styles. This principle is consistent with decisions such as Baker v. Selden, which established that copyright does not extend to abstract systems or methods. Applied here, stylistic imitation of Claude Monet does not infringe copyright absent copying of a specific protected work, explaining why the Monet-style image is legally permissible even though it resembles a well-known artistic style.

Together, these cases illustrate that legal copyright analysis relies on nuanced, context-specific reasoning that considers transformation, purpose, and market impact. This stands in contrast to YouTube’s automated enforcement system, which operates primarily through fingerprint matching and does not independently apply judicial fair use standards.

### Gap Analysis: Law, Policy, and Practice

Across the experiments, a consistent pattern emerges. Copyright law evaluates purpose, transformation, and market impact through nuanced legal standards. YouTube’s policy acknowledges fair use and provides dispute mechanisms. Actual enforcement, however, is driven almost entirely by automated fingerprint matching. As a result, clearly infringing content may be blocked immediately, as seen in the raw Premier League clip. Legally valid fair uses may still face risk if they trigger Content ID. At the same time, potentially infringing AI-generated content may remain unchallenged if it does not match known reference files.

This gap demonstrates that YouTube’s system prioritizes efficiency and scalability over legal precision. Enforcement outcomes are shaped less by copyright doctrine and more by the technical limits and incentives of automated systems.
